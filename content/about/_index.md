Born in 1980, when normal people had seen computers only in films, I was one of the few lucky kids who had a PC standing in our home by the end of the decade.

It was mainly for my father's work, but there were also some games I was allowed to play. So althought we didn't have a computer from the start, one could say I grew up with them and did what most kids did in those days: Use it for playing games.

When I was a teenager there was an Informatics club at my school, where one could learn programming. Of course I went there. We learned some Turbo Pascal. I remeber how exciting it was to put some pixels on screen and use the PC beeper to beep some tunes (I also remeber how it got on people's nerves when somebody forgot the nosound-command...).
There was not very much to learn in that club, and even when Informatics came as part of the curriculum, it hardly went beyond what I had been taught already. I remember we were also rather early to have an internet connection, but do you remember dialing up per modem? 9600 Baud was our first. And the connection was expensive, I can tell you. The Telekom had the monopoly back then and set prices high.
Add that I had no clue about what I could get from the internet, leave alone where to search, you can guess I didn't progress much in the field of programming.
Came Highschool graduation, military service, some volunteering abroad, 9/11...
In 2001 I went to university to study software systems engineering. Finally where I wanted to be. I learned a bit of Java, but mainly on a more abstract layer, programming concepts in general. I didn't suceed and dropped out without a degree. I also had the strong wish to become a pastor, so I started studying theology, which took quite a long time: I graduated in 2014. What followed was a course inside of the church for future pastors, from which I graduated in early 2017. It turned out the church wouldn't employ me. So since early 2017, I'm a homemaker - my wife earns the money, working as pastor. While I wasn't employed by the church myself, they still ordained me in summer 2017, so I am allowed to do anything a *proper* pastor could do. I just won't be paid for it. Suppose the church is short on money ;)
So here I was after a long education with hardly anything in my hand. I came across freecodecamp.org and remebered how I wanted to become a developer once. And I remembered that when I dropped out, my younger self had hardly been coding at university. There were only some short exercises in the most part. So I decided to go and try it again, this time actually coding. No economics lectures at the same time, no thousand conceptual seminars. Whenever I need more info, I do meanwhile know how to get it on the internet, or ask for help. My pace, my responsibility.

I don't know where this will lead eventually. I might start a code club for kids in my wife's congregation at some time. I might become good enough to add to some open source projects. I might even become good enough to land a job in the IT sector, but for now, I just want to learn and code.
