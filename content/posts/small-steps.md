Progress comes slowly. I spent a lot of time today to set up hugo on my laptop, so I can write on this blog from my desktop AND my laptop. I read a bit about JSONP, without really understanding how to use it, I'm afraid. But I could make the forismatic.com api work in my [Quote Machine](https://codepen.io/tonnerkiller/pen/xpPYmv).

I think I am now at the point where further APIs could be added easily, I wrote an apiArray where APIs can be put with the programm choosing one randomly for each new quote. I'd need more APIs for more tests, so if you know some, why not tell me via twitter?

What is missing is the social buttons of the free networks. Unlike twitter I cannot give the url to the server, as there are many servers, so I need a textfield for users to give the details before. This textfield could maybe even be used for given authentication credentials... The plan is to write an array just like the APIs, so the buttons would be created dynamically according to the array. Then a little code cleanup and polishing of the html/css to make it look good, with nice colours and all and the project is done.

This is a bit more than what is asked for by freecodecamp.org, and I am not sure by now whether it would have been a better idea to implement what is asked and leave it to this and move on to the next challenge. I used quite some time on this one and maybe I'd learn more if I implemented less per project. What do you think?

In the days to come I will have less time for coding, so I'll have to focus more than recently. Maybe this will help, too.
