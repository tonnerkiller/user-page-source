Hi, I am tonnerkiller: Father, homemaker, unemployed minister and since recently a learner of coding through means of the [freecodecamp.org](https://freecodecamp.org "Link to freecodecamp.org") 
curriculum. I read a lot about how 
documenting one's path as 
a
student of programming helps in progress, so I thought, why not start that? So I installed [hugo](https://gohugo.io) and [set up](https://charliegriefer.github.io/posts/2016/07/29/hugo-on-github-pages/ 
"The tutorial I 
followed") a [github user page](https://pages.github.com) to get started. I'll try to render an account of 
my daily progress, I might even try 
to explain things I just learnt myself, as "teach what you learn" is a concept I find very convincing.

To give you an idea how far in the curriculum I've come yet: I am working on the [Quote Machine Challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-random-quote-machine "Link to the Quote Machine 
Challenge") of the "Intermediate Front End Development Projects". I guess the project would mostly be ready now, but I want to polish it a bit: Make the Code extensible, to add further Quotes APIs and 
Social Buttons dynamically, and the html/css part also needs some work to make it responsive, look nicer, you name it.

This makes me dive into jQuery/AJAX a bit deeper, which is a good thing I presume, as learning is what is my overall intention in all this.

So be my guest on the path I'm taking, read along as I evolve, as I get stuck every now and then and as I grow finding my way out of the dead end streets along the way. Might be an interesting journey. I, 
for 
my part, am excited. :)
