Ever again small steps... Lessonof the day: If an API call suddenly doesn't work anymore, maybe it's just the API having changed... and when postings don't show up doesn't mean they failed, maybe there's just a delay due to the server only updating every 10 minutes or so...

The good news is, that the Hubzilla button is basically working (again with the new API) on the Quotes Machine. The bad news is, I haven't yet achieved more. And I am not sure whether $.getJSON() is working or whether I need to stick with window.open(). The thing is, that the API returns a JSON with a link to the actual posting. Showing that in a new window would be much nicer than having the JSON raw data printed there and needing to log in to Hubzilla and see the actual posting... Once this is done, I need to use Bootstrap Modals to get the username, server and password for the posting. Maybe, when I get better at Coding I might write a plugin for Hubzilla that would give all that functionality on their server to be accessed by sending the link. Isn't this how Twitter works?

So much for today. Ah, I see we are already tomorrow... I need to get to bed. Good night.
