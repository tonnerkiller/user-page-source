People tend to fail on the 10th commandment, that's basically why we lock things up. On our computers we use passwords and these were keeping me busy today.

That is to say: First I set a custom domain for this blog: tonnerkiller.de. It took a while but now it is working. But let me get back to the passwords.

I already mentioned that I wanted my Quote Machine not only to post to twitter, but also to free networks like Hubzilla or GNU.social (there are others like tent.io, Friendica, diapora, you name it, but for the time being I'll use these two for testing my software). I will have to deal with logging in there as they do not bring their own pop up window like twitter in this case. That's why I read about $.ajax(), $.post() and http authentication header field. I couldn't code much, except for a few tests that failed, but alas, it's late and I need to get up early tomorrow.

You see I still progress slowly but steadily. The more proud I'll be when the Quote Machine is finally done. Something to look forward for.
