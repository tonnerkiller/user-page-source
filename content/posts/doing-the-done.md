I submitted the Random Quotes Machine to Free Code Camp, so technically I guess, I gotta go to the next challenge: The weather app. But I still play around with the Quotes Machine and I might be doing for another while.

I have not yet gotten a grasop of all that styling of pages. Guess this front-end designing stuff is not for me, but still I want to have at least a basic understanding.

All I want is headline, buttons and quotation placed neatly on a single page without scroll bars appearing and without all being pushed up as much as possible. I want the quotation in the middle, the headline on top and the buttons on the bottom, with lots of spare space between them, but just enough to not exceed the shown page. This shouldn't be too hard to do, should it?

I switched from codepen.io to github with the app, and I have it hosted under http://tonnerkiller.de/quotes-machine/

So I can have the source and the running site all at the same place.

Another thing I did in recent days was install Atom text editor. I kind of like it, though I still don't understand it fully. It's a giant beast, but as I said: I like it. It feels lightweight, has plenty plugins to grow with, github integration...

I had more ideas for the Quotes Machine than just css polishing, but I came to the conclusion, that this is not for now. Among this was creating an image with text on it to post to twitter in case the letters exceed the limits twitter sets. But it seems you have to implement this server side. At least I found no client side solutions online. Plus I'd have to dig into oauth, which would be worthwhile to do, but a lot of work too, and leading too far from the path I intend to take, going on with the Free Code Camp.

I also leave the Javascript as it is, as restructuring would maybe make enhancements easier, but maybe not. I don't want to have it all complicated, and I can come back to it whenever I learn something useful and new, like oauth for example, or how to properly structure code.

For now I consider it done, as soon as it looks like I intend it to do. Then, next will be the weather app.
